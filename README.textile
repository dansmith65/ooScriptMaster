h1. WHAT

'ooScriptMaster' stands for object oriented ScriptMaster. "ScriptMaster":http://360works.com/scriptmaster/ is a plugin for "FileMaker":http://www.filemaker.com/ which allows you to write your own plugin in java/groovy.

h1. WHY

Plugin functions in ScriptMaster are completly separate from one another; if you write five different functions that all need to create a directory; you need a copy of code that creates a directory in each function. Because of this separation, it is also difficult to save a value in one function and retrieve it in another. ooScriptMaster resolves both of these problems.

h1. HOW

ooScriptMaster uses classes with static fields and methods. Every function declared in ScriptMaster.fp7 calls a static method in one of ooScriptMaster's classes where all the work is done.

h1. STATUS

This project is currently in pre-release state. When a beta release is available, I will post a download which will include ScriptMaster.fp7 containing ooScriptMaster.jar and with all the functions/parameters defined.
If you would like to get started with the project now, you will need to compile the code as a .jar file and refer to the documentation in the code to see what methods are available.

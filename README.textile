h1. WHAT

'ooScriptMaster' stands for object oriented ScriptMaster. "ScriptMaster":http://360works.com/scriptmaster/ is a plugin for "FileMaker":http://www.filemaker.com/ which allows you to write your own plugin in java/groovy.

h1. WHY

Plugin functions in ScriptMaster are completly separate from one another; if you write five different functions that all need to create a directory; you need a copy of code that creates a directory in each function. Because of this separation, it is also difficult to save a value in one function and retrieve it in another. ooScriptMaster resolves both of these problems.

h1. HOW

ooScriptMaster uses classes with static fields and methods. Every function declared in ScriptMaster.fp7 calls a static method in one of ooScriptMaster's classes where all the work is done.

h1. STATUS

All functions have been tested on Windows and most functions have been tested on Mac. There are no known issues.

In the "Download":https://github.com/dansmith65/ooScriptMaster/downloads section you can download a copy of a ScriptMaster.fp7 file containing ooScriptMaster.jar and all the functions/parameters of this project defined.
